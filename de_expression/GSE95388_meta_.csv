Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC17 payload. Each chamber housed 5 PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were 2 plates with wild type (WT) cells and 3 plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRICs on the ground in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as Ground Controls. The GroundControls were initiated with a 48 hrs delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber.

RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri Plate.

The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canister (BRIC) hardware. Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC17 payload. Each chamber housed 5 PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were 2 plates with wild type (WT) cells and 3 plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRICs on the ground in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as Ground Controls. The GroundControls were initiated with a 48 hrs delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were fixed in-flight in RNAlater on the 10th day on orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 hours later. RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri Plate.
