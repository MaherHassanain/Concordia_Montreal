Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC17 payload. Each chamber housed 5 PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were 2 plates with wild type (WT) cells and 3 plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRICs on the ground in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as Ground Controls. The GroundControls were initiated with a 48 hrs delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were fixed in-flight in RNAlater on the 10th day on orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 hours later. RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri Plate. Twenty four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the MELFI (Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) where it resided until cold stowage transport back to Earth within the Dragon capsule.  After returning to Earth the samples were reclaimed at KSC, and then transported to the University of Florida (UF) laboratories. The total RNA was extracted from splight samples and corresponding Ground Control samples and subjected to microarrays.","PlatformID":"GPL198","Type":"Expression profiling by array","Summary":"The Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2), as a part of the HSF network, is essential to the plant�s response to almost any environmental stress and to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms.
